**Predicting Term Deposit Subscription using Machine Learning**

This project explores supervised learning techniques to classify a dataset using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. After feature selection and handling class imbalances with SMOTE, hyperparameter tuning was performed using RandomizedSearchCV. The optimized Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy of 91%.

Key Features:
✔️ Data Preprocessing – Feature scaling, encoding, and handling imbalanced data.
✔️ Model Selection & Tuning – Comparing multiple classifiers and optimizing parameters.
✔️ Evaluation & Insights – Analyzing model performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

This project demonstrates classification modeling, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering for real-world datasets. 🚀
